Explanation
Scenario 1: CalculateAge

Purpose: Computes the age of a customer based on their date of birth.
Logic: Uses MONTHS_BETWEEN to calculate the total months between the current date and the date of birth, then divides by 12 to get the age in years.
Scenario 2: CalculateMonthlyInstallment

Purpose: Calculates the monthly installment amount for a loan based on the amount, annual interest rate, and duration.
Logic: Computes the monthly interest rate and number of payments. Uses the formula for calculating the monthly installment. Handles the case where the interest rate is 0 to avoid division by zero.
Scenario 3: HasSufficientBalance

Purpose: Checks if a given account has sufficient balance to cover a specified amount.
Logic: Queries the account balance and compares it with the required amount. Returns FALSE if the account does not exist or has insufficient funds.

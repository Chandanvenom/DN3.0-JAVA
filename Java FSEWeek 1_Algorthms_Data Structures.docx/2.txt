E-commerce Platform Search Function: Exercise 2
1. Understand Asymptotic Notation:
Big O Notation:
Big O notation is a mathematical notation used to describe the upper bound of the time complexity of an algorithm. It provides a way to express the worst-case scenario of an algorithm’s runtime as a function of the input size, ignoring constant factors and lower-order terms.

O(1) (Constant Time): The runtime is constant regardless of the input size. For example, accessing an element in an array by index.
O(n) (Linear Time): The runtime grows linearly with the input size. For example, searching for an item in an unsorted list.
O(log n) (Logarithmic Time): The runtime grows logarithmically with the input size. For example, binary search in a sorted array.
O(n^2) (Quadratic Time): The runtime grows quadratically with the input size. For example, bubble sort.
Best, Average, and Worst-Case Scenarios for Search Operations:

Linear Search:

Best Case: O(1) – The target element is at the first position in the array.
Average Case: O(n) – The target element is somewhere in the middle of the array.
Worst Case: O(n) – The target element is at the last position or not present in the array.
Binary Search:

Best Case: O(1) – The target element is at the middle of the array.
Average Case: O(log n) – The array is repeatedly divided in half until the target is found or all possibilities are exhausted.
Worst Case: O(log n) – The target element is not present, requiring complete traversal of the search space.
2. Setup:
Create a Product class with attributes for searching, such as productId, productName, and category.

Product Class Definition:

java

public class Product {
    private String productId;
    private String productName;
    private String category;

    // Constructor
    public Product(String productId, String productName, String category) {
        this.productId = productId;
        this.productName = productName;
        this.category = category;
    }

    // Getters
    public String getProductId() {
        return productId;
    }

    public String getProductName() {
        return productName;
    }

    public String getCategory() {
        return category;
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return "Product{" +
                "productId='" + productId + '\'' +
                ", productName='" + productName + '\'' +
                ", category='" + category + '\'' +
                '}';
    }
}
3. Implementation:
Linear Search Algorithm:

java

public class SearchAlgorithms {
    // Linear Search
    public static Product linearSearch(Product[] products, String searchId) {
        for (Product product : products) {
            if (product.getProductId().equals(searchId)) {
                return product;
            }
        }
        return null; // Not found
    }
}
Binary Search Algorithm:

To perform binary search, the array needs to be sorted by productId.

java
Copy code
import java.util.Arrays;

public class SearchAlgorithms {
    // Binary Search
    public static Product binarySearch(Product[] products, String searchId) {
        int left = 0;
        int right = products.length - 1;

        while (left <= right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            if (products[mid].getProductId().equals(searchId)) {
                return products[mid];
            }
            if (products[mid].getProductId().compareTo(searchId) < 0) {
                left = mid + 1;
            } else {
                right = mid - 1;
            }
        }
        return null; // Not found
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Product[] products = {
            new Product("1", "Laptop", "Electronics"),
            new Product("2", "Smartphone", "Electronics"),
            new Product("3", "Coffee Maker", "Appliances")
        };

        // Sort products by productId for binary search
        Arrays.sort(products, (p1, p2) -> p1.getProductId().compareTo(p2.getProductId()));

        // Perform Linear Search
        Product resultLinear = linearSearch(products, "2");
        System.out.println("Linear Search Result: " + resultLinear);

        // Perform Binary Search
        Product resultBinary = binarySearch(products, "2");
        System.out.println("Binary Search Result: " + resultBinary);
    }
}
4. Analysis:
Time Complexity Comparison:

Linear Search:

Time Complexity: O(n) – It checks each element sequentially until it finds the target or reaches the end.
Space Complexity: O(1) – It uses a constant amount of additional space.
Binary Search:

Time Complexity: O(log n) – It divides the search interval in half each time, making it significantly faster than linear search for large datasets.
Space Complexity: O(1) – The additional space used is constant, not dependent on the size of the input.
Which Algorithm is More Suitable?

Binary Search: More suitable for the e-commerce platform, provided that the product list is sorted by productId (or the search key). Its logarithmic time complexity makes it much faster for large datasets compared to linear search.
Linear Search: Simpler and can be used if t
